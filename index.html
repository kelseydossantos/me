        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! I'm Kelsey Dos Santos, a passionate software engineer on the path to excellence. Currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in software engineering at Western Governors University, I am set to graduate in September 2024.
            My journey in the world of technology has been driven by curiosity and a relentless desire to create and collaborate. I believe in the power of code to transform ideas into reality and make a positive impact on the world.
